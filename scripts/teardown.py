"""Launchpad teardown CLI — best-effort removal of everything bootstrap created.

Scope (reverse creation order, dependents before the shared substrate):
  1. Gateway targets of launchpad-gw / launchpad-kb-gw, then the two gateways
     themselves (matched by gateway name; they reference the Cognito pool and
     the IAM roles that go with the stack)
  2. Cedar Policy Engines Launchpad created for those gateways (tagged
     managed-by agentcore-launchpad, and attached to one of them or described
     as "Policy Engine managed from Launchpad for <gateway>"), policies first.
     Policy names are unique across the account and Region, so a leftover
     engine's policies would block the next deployment's identically named ones
  3. Credential providers launchpad-office-facts-key (API key) and
     launchpad-gw-m2m (OAuth2), matched by exact name
  3b. Console workload identities launchpad-console-* (the COA context layer's
     token-vault identity, one per workspace; the Connection it used is a
     Connection like any other and is deleted from the console)
  4. Per-agent IAM roles: launchpad-agent-* carrying the launchpad:agent-id
     tag. Every per-agent role is tagged at creation, so this matches the roles
     of agents you have not deleted yet as well as the orphans a failed agent
     deletion leaves behind — delete demo agents first. The stack-owned
     launchpad-agent-execution-role is never matched, nor is a role whose
     policies name another Region (IAM is account-global; that role serves
     another deployment's agent)
  5. AgentCore memory  (launchpad_memory-*)
  6. AgentCore registry (launchpad-registry) — records must be gone first
  7. Skill Lab exec worker (launchpad_skill_lab_worker runtime + its IAM role);
     its image tags and the skill-lab/ S3 prefix live in stack-owned ECR/S3
  7b. Coding runtime (launchpad_coding_runtime runtime + its IAM role, runtime
     first); its image tags and the coding/ repo snapshots live in
     stack-owned ECR/S3
  8. CDK stack launchpad-base (S3 bucket auto-empties, ECR force-deletes)

Out of scope: X-Ray Transaction Search (account-wide, shared observability)
and deployed agent runtimes — delete demo agents from the
console/API first.

Usage:
    cd backend && uv run python ../scripts/teardown.py --dry-run
